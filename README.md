# Algorithms & Data Structures for Data Science

### University of Pisa 2023/2024
This repository contains the code developed during the Algorithms & Data Structures for Data Science course. The focus of the course was on implementing classic algorithms and understanding how Python's data structures work under the hood. The code covers:

- Implementation of well-known sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and graph algorithms.
- Exercises aimed at deepening the understanding of Pythonâ€™s data structures and their methods.
After implementing algorithms from scratch, I applied them to solve specific problems with time complexity constraints, gaining hands-on experience in performance optimization.

### Key Takeaways:
While Python provides highly efficient, off-the-shelf solutions for most common problems, implementing these structures and algorithms manually offers valuable insights. Understanding how they work enables a deeper comprehension of how to optimize and speed up your code in real-world applications.


### Algorithms:
##### Sorting
- Selection Sort
- Insertion sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Select
##### Heap (Methods)
- Open Addressing with linear probing
- Hasing with chains
##### Binary Search Tree
