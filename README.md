# Algorithms & Data Structures

##### This file has been produced during the course of Algorithms and Data Structure for data science and contains exercises and simultations. The aim of the work was to allow a depper understanding of the main data structure used in python. The idea was to personalise existing libraries and off the shelves solutions to empirically get how a data structure works and how it may be optimized in order to deal with specific problems. The code provides solutions about sorting problems, searching problmes, hashing, dictionary, heap, binary tree and graphs.
